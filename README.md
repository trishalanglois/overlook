# Come Stay at the Lucid Hotel -- Where Dreams Come True

## Description

The Lucid Hotel is a variation of the Overlook Hotel project.  This project was the culminating solo project for Mod 2.  The project included key ideas from Mod 2 including fetches, inheritance, designing an effective UX/UI, building an accessible app, using jQuery and Sass.

The Lucid Hotel is set up with three classes, TapeChart, Guest, and Manager, with Manager being a subclass of Guest.  The app is also fetching, posting, and deleting data.  The UI is meant to make the guests and managers using the app to feel pampered and indulged.
